# Subtitution Cypher
This is an experimental repo to play around and to try out stuff.

I just started to have an interest in cryptography so in order to have a better understanding about this topic, I am trying to build some crypto algorithms.

Hints and improvement tips are more than welcome, after all I am still a beginner in cryptography, python and computer science in general.
